\chapter{Instructions for the Flyntian Modality}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textsc{ Stop all \enquote{gross believing,} such as belief in other minds, causality, and the phantom entities of science (atoms, electrons, \etc).}

\item \textsc{Stop thinking in propositional language.}

\item \textsc{Stop all scientific hypothesizing. Do not consider your "sightings" of the empire state building as confirmations that it is there when you are not looking at it --- or for that matter, as confirmations that it is there when you \emph{are} looking at it.}

\item \textsc{Stop organizing visual experiences and tactile experiences into object-gestalts. Stop organizing so-called "different spatial orientations or different touched surfaces of objects" into object-gestalts. That is, stop having perceptions of objects.}

\item \textsc{Stop believing in past and future time. That is, live out of time. Stop feeling longing, dread, or regret.}

\item \textsc{Stop believing that you can move your body.}

\item \textsc{Stop believing that these instructions have any objective meaning.}

\item \textsc{You are now free to walk through walls (if you can find them).}
\end{enumerate}
